In this post we will have a look at the possible markdown features and the source code highlighting of _jekyll_.

In this section there are some comments in C++ syntax.

{% highlight cpp %}
#include <stdio>

int main(void) {
    std::cout << "Hello World" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}
